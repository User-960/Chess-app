# Game-chess

The main purpose of the project is to write the project on stack: React, TypeScript, Next.js and use OOP. The project itself is a simple chess.

### Project Opportunities

All elements of the game are created as abstract classes with their own logic. Example: each instance of a chess figure has a move logic, mobility, color, available cell, direction logic. All this logic is presented in the form of class methods.

## What is used:

- Programming languages: HTML, CSS, TypeScript;
- Preprocessor: SCSS;
- Libraries: React, Next.js;

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
